- linearly independent adds another span to the vectors
- > **“A basis is a set of linearly independent vectors that span the full space.”**

It means:

👉 These vectors are the smallest possible set  
👉 You can combine them to form ANY vector in the space  
👉 No vector in the basis is redundant  
👉 They describe the entire space with the minimum number of building blocks
