- working on warehouse and inventory modules 
- made warehouse model but now confused if there is to be multiple warehouses in a single city/country and what not , maybe i can extend it using classes later on to link the warehouses to cities/coutries
- encountered  a problem with subcategory list url since it requires pk of category in the url 
- i can further reduce the code with DRY method and class inheritance 
- realized i didn't know how to redirect by clicking on a warehouse to inventory page with selected warehouse 
	- ```
	  {% if request.GET.warehouse %}
    <div class="bg-blue-50 border border-blue-200 text-blue-800 px-4 py-2 rounded-lg mb-4">
        Showing inventory for: 
        <strong>{{ inventory_items.first.warehouse.name }}</strong>
        <a href="{% url 'inventory:inventory_list' %}" class="ml-2 text-blue-600 hover:underline text-sm">
            Clear Filter
        </a>
    </div>
	{% endif %}
	  ```
	```
	<td class="px-6 py-4 font-medium text-gray-800">
    <a href="{% url 'inventory:inventory_list' %}?warehouse={{ warehouse.id }}"
       class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">
        {{ warehouse.name }}
    </a>
</td>

	```
