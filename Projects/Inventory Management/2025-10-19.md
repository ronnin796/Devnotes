## Bug encountered , sales not being added for other warehouses
- sale form was broken
- creating inve of same product in diffrent ware house cause it to return multiple objects in hte form
- there was a problem in the form 
- Great! 🎉 Here’s what I actually fixed in your forms so it started working:

1. **Warehouse-aware product filtering**
    
    - Before, your `SalesItemForm` used this:
        
        `Product.objects.filter(inventory_entries__id=warehouse_id)`
        
        But `inventory_entries__id` points to **Inventory entry**, not the warehouse. That caused `MultipleObjectsReturned` when the same product exists in multiple warehouses.
        
    - Fixed by using:
        
        `Product.objects.filter(inventory_entries__warehouse_id=warehouse_id).distinct()`
        
        ✅ This ensures only products **actually in the selected warehouse** appear, and `distinct()` prevents duplicates.
